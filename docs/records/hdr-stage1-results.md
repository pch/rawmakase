# HDR stage 1: references, codec and display feasibility

Status: in progress, 2026-11-05. Stage 1 of the
[HDR implementation plan](hdr-implementation-plan.md). It records what was measured,
the decisions taken from it and what remains open. The plan's other stages are
tracked in [Progress](#progress).

## Reference harness

`scripts/corpus/hdr_reference.py` captures a separate HDR reference family through
Photoshop and Camera Raw. It never reads or writes the SDR parity corpus. Each job
hashes the source and the DCP, opens a temporary copy, and keeps the full-resolution
16-bit TIFF, the requested and returned XMP, and the ICC profile's hash. It also
keeps a linear Display P3 array reduced by an area mean in linear light (factor 8
by default, partial edge blocks kept). PQ is decoded with the ST 2084 EOTF and
normalised so that 203 cd/m² is 1.0. The script's unit tests cover the PQ anchors,
linear reduction with highlights and negatives, and metrics that cannot hide
highlight clipping.

The references below are local diagnostics on a CC0 Nikon Z 8 NEF from raw.pixls.us
(8256×5504, Camera Standard and Camera Standard HDR DCPs). They were made with
Camera Raw 18.7 (2743), Process Version 15.4, lens and detail processing off, As
Shot white balance, and output to 16-bit P3 PQ (HDR) or Display P3 (SDR). They are
not frozen parity references. The frozen family needs the validation/holdout split
the plan asks for, and the merges and synthetic fixtures listed under
[Open](#open).

## Measurements

| Question | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Repeatability | Two captures with identical settings are bit-identical (all metrics 0). The reference noise floor is 0. |
| PQ quantisation | One 16-bit PQ code step is 0.0002 stops at graphics white and at 16× it. It is never the limiting tolerance. |
| Graphics white | Camera Raw's PQ output puts graphics white at 203 cd/m². With `HDRMaxValue` = L, the brightest pixel is 2^L × white: 16.0012 at L=4 and 1.99988 at L=1. |
| `HDRMaxValue` | Stops above graphics white. Camera Raw keeps 1, 2.37, 4, 5, 6 and 8. It replaces 0, 0.99, −1 and 10 with +2.30, and uses +2.30 when the key is absent. It writes `+4.00`. |
| HDR limit shape | A roll-off, not a clip. At L=1 the luminance p90 falls from 2.46 to 1.54 (it would be 2.0 if clipped), and the share of pixels above white barely changes (11.37% to 11.31%). |
| Midtones, HDR against SDR | With the same profile, luminance below 0.5 differs by a median 0.001 stop (p99 0.071). From 0.5 to 1.0, HDR is a median 0.074 stop brighter, and above white it extends to the limit. |
| SDR rendition | `SDRBrightness` +50 leaves the HDR master bit-identical. The sliders are −100 to +100 (`SDRBlend` too); 150 and −150 read as 0. Values set with HDR off are kept in the returned XMP. |
| Exposure +1 (HDR) | Luminance p50 0.075 → 0.204, p99 4.43 → 11.64, peak 5.16 → 13.11. |
| Highlights −100 (HDR) | p99 4.43 → 1.10, peak 16.0 → 8.41 (channel maximum). |
| Whites −100 (HDR) | p99 4.43 → 2.04, peak 16.0 → 11.65 (channel maximum). |
| HDR camera profile | The Camera Standard HDR DCP with HDR on renders different midtones from Camera Standard (p50 0.117 against 0.075) and peaks lower (channel maximum 3.82, luminance 3.46). |

These settle the XMP contract implemented in stage 2: units, ranges, defaults,
Camera Raw's replacement of invalid values, and the preservation of dormant values.

## Tolerances

The reference is deterministic, so every tolerance is a parity target for the
engine, not a measurement allowance. They are provisional until the frozen family
exists and must not be loosened to pass a candidate.

Comparisons use linear P3 normalised to 203 cd/m², after the same linear-area
reduction on both sides, per photo:

- **Exact contracts:** SDR rendition controls never change the HDR master (bit
  equality of RAWmakase's own HDR output). The rendered peak never exceeds
  2^limit × white, with 0.01 stop of quantisation allowance.
- **HDR tone (validation, then holdout):** for pixels whose reference luminance is
  above 1.0, the median |log2 luminance error| is ≤ 0.15 stop and the p95 is
  ≤ 0.35 stop. The peak is within 0.1 stop of the reference.
- **Below white:** the SDR gate (metric policy 2) applies to the SDR rendition.
  RAWmakase's HDR and SDR renders of one edit must agree below 0.5 luminance as
  closely as Camera Raw's do (median ≤ 0.002 stop, p99 ≤ 0.1 stop).
- **Colour:** mean ΔE_ITP ≤ 5 and p95 ≤ 15 (ITU-R BT.2124 units), reported with the
  luminance metrics. Saturated and gamut-edge patches are reported separately.

## Codecs

**JPEG XL encoder.** The plan's Rust-first evaluation found:

- `jxl-encoder` (pure Rust, VarDCT) is AGPL-3.0 or commercial. It is incompatible
  with RAWmakase's MIT licence and was not used or read.
- `zune-jpegxl` (MIT/Apache-2.0/Zlib) is a lossless modular encoder that writes a
  fixed sRGB header. A local spike patched its header to write enumerated colour
  encodings and a `ToneMapping` intensity target. PQ and HLG with P3 and Rec.2100
  primaries, and linear P3, all decode as signalled in libjxl 0.12 (`jxlinfo`,
  `djxl`) and jxl-oxide 0.12, losslessly (exact code values). Pure-Rust PQ/HLG
  signalling is therefore feasible.
- Size decides the export path. The 45 MP P3 PQ reference above is 197 MB as 16-bit
  lossless JXL (1.7 s), against 10.2 MB from libjxl at distance 1, effort 7 (19 s).
  The 16-bit TIFF is 273 MB. Lossless-only output is a valid interchange
  fallback, but not a credible replacement for the lossy JXL exports #894 asks for.

Decision: no Rust encoder qualifies for lossy HDR JXL. The owner deferred the libjxl
dependency on 2026-11-05. #906 records the proposal, its consequences and a build
spike. Until #906 is decided, HDR JXL export is lossless only, through the Rust
path. HDR editing, gain-map bundling and TIFF interchange continue.

**Gain-map bundle.** libjxl's `lib/extras/gain_map.cc` defines the `jhgm` box:
a version byte (0), a big-endian u16 size and the ISO 21496-1 metadata, a u8 size and
a bit-packed `ColorEncoding` for the alternate rendition, a big-endian u32 size and a
Brotli-compressed ICC, then the gain map as a naked codestream (the rest of the box).
The writer and reader need no libjxl. The map's codestream needs the same encoder as
the base image.

**Independent oracles available locally:** libjxl 0.12 (`cjxl`, `djxl`,
`jxlinfo`), jxl-oxide, libultrahdr 2.0.2 (`ultrahdr_app`: ISO 21496-1 and Adobe
gain-map JPEGs), libheif 1.23 (`heif-enc`: PQ/HLG HEIC with CICP), and exiftool.
They are used for fixtures and validation only; none is a runtime dependency.

## Open

- Lossy HDR JXL: deferred to #906.
- Fixtures: synthetic PQ, HLG and gain-map files from the tools above, plus a camera
  HLG/PQ HEIF and an Apple gain-map HEIC/JPEG, which need a real capture. Synthetic
  ramps crossing white, saturated highlights and negative matrix results.
- Frozen family: Lightroom and HDRMerge merges, a validation/holdout split, curves,
  masks and SDR rendition captures. Camera Raw's TIFF output carries no SDR
  rendition, so this needs a gain-map export path.
- Opening defaults for unedited PQ, HLG and gain-map sources, and HDR toggling with
  unavailable paired profiles.
- A float HDR photo surface through eframe/wgpu (EDR on macOS).

## Progress

- [ ] Stage 1: harness, Nikon measurements and codec spike done; fixtures, frozen
  family and display prototype open. The libjxl decision is deferred to #906.
- [ ] Stage 2: HDR settings in the recipe (`model::hdr`), schema 14 and catalog
  version 6 for HDR on, values kept while off without a format change, XMP and
  Lightroom reading and writing, presets, the High Dynamic Range Copy/Sync group,
  and one shared guard refusing HDR on. Profile grouping (52552) and the previous
  reader's profile check are left for stage 3's DCP work.
- [ ] Stages 3–6 not started.
