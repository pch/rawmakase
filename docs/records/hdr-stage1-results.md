# HDR results: references, measurements and progress

Status: in progress, 2026-11-06. The record of the
[HDR implementation plan](hdr-implementation-plan.md): what was measured, the
decisions taken from it, validation results and what remains open. Stage 1 (references,
codec and display feasibility) comes first; stage 3's rendering measurements follow
in [HDR rendering](#hdr-rendering). Progress on every stage is in
[Progress](#progress). The rendering contract itself is [HDR](../hdr.md).

## Reference harness

`scripts/corpus/hdr_reference.py` captures a separate HDR reference family through
Photoshop and Camera Raw. It never reads or writes the SDR parity corpus. Each job
hashes the source and the DCP, opens a temporary copy, and keeps the full-resolution
16-bit TIFF, the requested and returned XMP, and the ICC profile's hash. It also
keeps a linear Display P3 array reduced by an area mean in linear light (factor 8
by default, partial edge blocks kept). PQ is decoded with the ST 2084 EOTF and
normalised so that 203 cd/m² is 1.0. The script's unit tests cover the PQ anchors,
linear reduction with highlights and negatives, and metrics that cannot hide
highlight clipping.

The references below are local diagnostics on a CC0 Nikon Z 8 NEF from raw.pixls.us
(8256×5504, Camera Standard and Camera Standard HDR DCPs). They were made with
Camera Raw 18.7 (2743), Process Version 15.4, lens and detail processing off, As
Shot white balance, and output to 16-bit P3 PQ (HDR) or Display P3 (SDR). They are
not frozen parity references. The frozen family needs the validation/holdout split
the plan asks for, and the merges and synthetic fixtures listed under
[Open](#open).

## Measurements

| Question | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Repeatability | Two captures with identical settings are bit-identical (all metrics 0). The reference noise floor is 0. |
| PQ quantisation | One 16-bit PQ code step is 0.0002 stops at graphics white and at 16× it. It is never the limiting tolerance. |
| Graphics white | Camera Raw's PQ output puts graphics white at 203 cd/m². With `HDRMaxValue` = L, the brightest pixel is 2^L × white: 16.0012 at L=4 and 1.99988 at L=1. |
| `HDRMaxValue` | Stops above graphics white. Camera Raw keeps 1, 2.37, 4, 5, 6 and 8. It replaces 0, 0.99, −1 and 10 with +2.30, and uses +2.30 when the key is absent. It writes `+4.00`. |
| HDR limit shape | A roll-off, not a clip. At L=1 the luminance p90 falls from 2.46 to 1.54 (it would be 2.0 if clipped), and the share of pixels above white barely changes (11.37% to 11.31%). |
| Midtones, HDR against SDR | With the same profile, luminance below 0.5 differs by a median 0.001 stop (p99 0.071). From 0.5 to 1.0, HDR is a median 0.074 stop brighter, and above white it extends to the limit. |
| SDR rendition | `SDRBrightness` +50 leaves the HDR master bit-identical. The sliders are −100 to +100 (`SDRBlend` too); 150 and −150 read as 0. Values set with HDR off are kept in the returned XMP. |
| Exposure +1 (HDR) | Luminance p50 0.075 → 0.204, p99 4.43 → 11.64, peak 5.16 → 13.11. |
| Highlights −100 (HDR) | p99 4.43 → 1.10, peak 16.0 → 8.41 (channel maximum). |
| Whites −100 (HDR) | p99 4.43 → 2.04, peak 16.0 → 11.65 (channel maximum). |
| HDR camera profile | The Camera Standard HDR DCP with HDR on renders different midtones from Camera Standard (p50 0.117 against 0.075) and peaks lower (channel maximum 3.82, luminance 3.46). |

These settle the XMP contract implemented in stage 2: units, ranges, defaults,
Camera Raw's replacement of invalid values, and the preservation of dormant values.

## Tolerances

The reference is deterministic, so every tolerance is a parity target for the
engine, not a measurement allowance. They are provisional until the frozen family
exists and must not be loosened to pass a candidate.

Comparisons use linear P3 normalised to 203 cd/m², after the same linear-area
reduction on both sides, per photo:

- **Exact contracts:** SDR rendition controls never change the HDR master (bit
  equality of RAWmakase's own HDR output). The rendered peak never exceeds
  2^limit × white, with 0.01 stop of quantisation allowance.
- **HDR tone (validation, then holdout):** for pixels whose reference luminance is
  above 1.0, the median |log2 luminance error| is ≤ 0.15 stop and the p95 is
  ≤ 0.35 stop. The peak is within 0.1 stop of the reference.
- **Below white:** the SDR gate (metric policy 2) applies to the SDR rendition.
  RAWmakase's HDR and SDR renders of one edit must agree below 0.5 luminance as
  closely as Camera Raw's do (median ≤ 0.002 stop, p99 ≤ 0.1 stop).
- **Colour:** mean ΔE_ITP ≤ 5 and p95 ≤ 15 (ITU-R BT.2124 units), reported with the
  luminance metrics. Saturated and gamut-edge patches are reported separately.

## Codecs

**JPEG XL encoder.** The plan's Rust-first evaluation found:

- `jxl-encoder` (pure Rust, VarDCT) is AGPL-3.0 or commercial. It is incompatible
  with RAWmakase's MIT licence and was not used or read.
- `zune-jpegxl` (MIT/Apache-2.0/Zlib) is a lossless modular encoder that writes a
  fixed sRGB header. A local spike patched its header to write enumerated colour
  encodings and a `ToneMapping` intensity target. PQ and HLG with P3 and Rec.2100
  primaries, and linear P3, all decode as signalled in libjxl 0.12 (`jxlinfo`,
  `djxl`) and jxl-oxide 0.12, losslessly (exact code values). Pure-Rust PQ/HLG
  signalling is therefore feasible.
- Size decides the export path. The 45 MP P3 PQ reference above is 197 MB as 16-bit
  lossless JXL (1.7 s), against 10.2 MB from libjxl at distance 1, effort 7 (19 s).
  The 16-bit TIFF is 273 MB. Lossless-only output is a valid interchange
  fallback, but not a credible replacement for the lossy JXL exports #894 asks for.

Decision: no Rust encoder qualifies for lossy HDR JXL. The owner deferred the libjxl
dependency on 2026-11-05. #906 records the proposal, its consequences and a build
spike. Until #906 is decided, HDR JXL export is lossless only, through the Rust
path. HDR editing, gain-map bundling and TIFF interchange continue.

**Gain-map bundle.** libjxl's `lib/extras/gain_map.cc` defines the `jhgm` box:
a version byte (0), a big-endian u16 size and the ISO 21496-1 metadata, a u8 size and
a bit-packed `ColorEncoding` for the alternate rendition, a big-endian u32 size and a
Brotli-compressed ICC, then the gain map as a naked codestream (the rest of the box).
The writer and reader need no libjxl. The map's codestream needs the same encoder as
the base image.

**Independent oracles available locally:** libjxl 0.12 (`cjxl`, `djxl`,
`jxlinfo`), jxl-oxide, libultrahdr 2.0.2 (`ultrahdr_app`: ISO 21496-1 and Adobe
gain-map JPEGs), libheif 1.23 (`heif-enc`: PQ/HLG HEIC with CICP), and exiftool.
They are used for fixtures and validation only; none is a runtime dependency.

## HDR rendering

Measured with Camera Raw 18.7 on synthetic gray-ramp DNGs (`probe_dng.py`, 192
patches over 14 stops, a linear embedded profile unless stated), captured as P3 PQ
16-bit through `hdr_reference.py`, graphics white 1. Probe sets are local; their
results are below and in the engine's measured tables.

**Scene tone stage.** With a linear profile the default HDR render is the scene
itself from 0.5 up (to 0.004 stop), with the SDR default black point's toe below,
at sensor whites 1, 4, 16 and 64 and limits 1 to 8. The limit rolls off only at the
top: scene 16 renders as 15.84 at limit 4; peaks above 49.26 are PQ's 10,000-nit
ceiling, not the limit. Exposure ±1 and ±2 are gains. Blacks −100 to +100 match the
SDR render below 0.25 (0.001 stop) and leave values above white alone. Negative
Whites is a gain over scene value, the same at sensor whites 4, 16 and 64, photo
maxima 0.5 to 8 and limits 2.3 and 8. Positive Whites is not: on ramps whose maximum
is below about 2, Camera Raw stretches much further (+3.8 stops at scene 0.3 on a
ramp peaking at 0.5, +0.9 on one peaking at 8), and on photos it follows their
bright end. It is refused in HDR until measured. Contrast, Highlights and Shadows
depend on the photo (Highlights −100 holds a ramp at 0.25–0.28 above 0.3); not fitted.

**Ordinary profile curves.** Camera Raw does not extend an ordinary (SDR) profile's
curve by the DNG SDK's slope rule or the overrange rule. Measured on the ramp:

- Curves that never rise above the identity (linear, x^1.1, x^1.25, x², a knee of
  slope 0.5 then 1.5) render as the identity in HDR, ignoring the curve.
- Any brightening curve renders close to one common extension above white: at scene
  1.2 the ACR3 curve and 57 camera-matching curves render between 3.4 and 3.6 (the SDR
  curve gives 1). Curves that render brighter upper midtones render lower highlights.
- Absent and explicit ACR3 curves render identically, and the result does not depend
  on the sensor's white (white +2 against +4 agree).
- Gamma curves without a toe (x^0.6 to x^0.9) and steep filmic curves depart from
  the camera curves' extension: x^0.9, nearly the identity, renders scene 0.43 as 0.89.

RAWmakase renders the ACR3 curve's HDR extension as measured, and other curves as it
times a gain linear in the curve's log2 ratio to ACR3 at twelve inputs and at the
pixel's input, with weights per scene value fitted on the 58 camera-matching curves
(from 9 makers' installed DCPs, captured as probe curves only). Left out one at a
time, 52 curves have a median error above white of 0.05 stop or less; the worst
sample is 0.27 stop (Panasonic Cinelike V2). A curve whose twelve ratios are more
than 4 (Mahalanobis) from the fitted curves' is refused: that excludes the toeless
gammas and steep filmic curves the fit misses, and two of the 58.

**HDR profiles.** The DNG SDK rule (overrange encoding, RGBTone on encoded values,
slope extension above encoded 1, 3D tables on encoded values) renders Camera Standard
HDR within 0.01 stop median above white on six of six photos.

### Validation

`scripts/corpus/hdr_validate.py` renders each HDR job of the family with
`rawmakase render --hdr` and compares as the references were reduced (factor 8,
linear Display P3). Twelve CC0 raw.pixls.us photos, Adobe Standard (the ACR3 curve
and the camera's look table) and Camera Standard HDR, HDR limit 4 unless stated.
`rel` compares how far HDR departs from SDR, ours against Camera Raw's, which
separates the HDR extension from differences both renders share; `SDR` is the SDR
render's own median luminance error against Camera Raw.

| Photo (split) | Default above white: median / p95 | rel p95 | peak | ΔE_ITP mean / p95 | SDR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nikon Z 8 (validation) | 0.061 / 0.096 | 0.094 | +0.078 | 2.9 / 7.0 | 0.010 |
| Nikon Z f (validation) | 0.007 / 0.009 | 0.018 | +0.007 | 0.9 / 2.9 | 0.006 |
| Nikon Z6 III (validation) | 0.014 / 0.131 | 0.129 | **+0.108** | 1.4 / 3.7 | 0.011 |
| Panasonic S1M2 (validation) | 0.061 / **0.395** | 0.271 | −0.012 | **27.4 / 110** | **0.116** |
| Sony A7R III (validation) | 0.032 / 0.075 | 0.072 | −0.011 | 0.9 / 1.9 | 0.005 |
| Canon 850D (validation) | 0.032 / 0.035 | 0.034 | +0.025 | 1.6 / 2.4 | 0.028 |
| Nikon Z50 II (holdout) | 0.012 / 0.020 | 0.008 | +0.082 | 1.3 / 2.7 | 0.018 |
| Nikon Z5 II (holdout) | 0.017 / 0.025 | 0.012 | −0.011 | 2.2 / 4.5 | 0.010 |
| Panasonic S1M2ES (holdout) | 0.078 / **1.55** | **0.444** | −0.030 | **24.1 / 91** | **0.220** |
| Fujifilm X100V (holdout) | 0.030 / 0.063 | 0.051 | **+0.360** | **5.6 / 19.4** | 0.041 |
| Sony A7R IV (holdout) | 0.045 / 0.061 | 0.080 | +0.026 | 1.4 / 3.9 | 0.013 |
| Pentax K-1 II (holdout) | none above white | — | +0.025 | **9.6 / 29.7** | **0.121** |

Camera Standard HDR: median above white 0.001–0.008 on the four Nikons and the
Z50 II/Z5 II, 0.05–0.09 on the two Panasonics. Exposure ±1, Whites −100, Blacks −100
and limits 2.3 and 6 stay within the tolerances on the same photos as the default.
Below 0.5, RAWmakase's HDR and SDR renders agree as Camera Raw's do on every photo
(p99 0.005–0.28 against Camera Raw's 0.016–0.289 on the same photos; medians ≤ 0.003).

Re-run after the limit was made to apply once, last: every number above is unchanged to 0.01 stop (limit 2.3 on the Z 8: median 0.051, p95 0.099).

Eight of twelve photos pass every tolerance. The failures are not the HDR extension:

- The two Panasonics and the Pentax have SDR errors of 0.12–0.22 stop median against
  Camera Raw already (a pre-existing SDR gap for these bodies); HDR inherits them.
- The X100V's and Z6 III's peaks are specular highlights rebuilt above the sensor's
  clip. SDR clips them at white, HDR shows the reconstruction's values (known to
  differ from Camera Raw's; decode, not tone).

### Decisions

- **The SDR rendition is the edit with HDR off.** Camera Raw's own default SDR
  rendition is unmeasured (its TIFF output has none); the SDR rendition sliders refuse
  the master until measured.
- **Unmeasured adjustments refuse the HDR master, not the edit.** An imported or
  edited HDR edit with Clarity, a look or positive Whites keeps HDR on and stays
  valid; its SDR rendition renders it, and the master (HDR export) is refused with
  the reason, shown in Develop under the HDR switch. Refusing the edit itself would
  make Develop's ordinary sliders fail to render whenever HDR is on.
- **The release guard is lifted** (`model::hdr::renders`): every SDR caller receives
  the SDR rendition through `Recipe::resolved`, the GPU refuses HDR recipes, and the
  master is reached only through `render_hdr`.

## Open

- Lossy HDR JXL: deferred to #906.
- Positive Whites, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows and the colour stage in HDR.
- The SDR rendition sliders and Camera Raw's default SDR rendition.
- Looks (Adobe Color and other enhanced profiles) in HDR: the most common profile in
  Lightroom edits, so the next measurement.
- Fixtures: synthetic PQ, HLG and gain-map files from the tools above, plus a camera
  HLG/PQ HEIF and an Apple gain-map HEIC/JPEG, which need a real capture. Synthetic
  ramps crossing white, saturated highlights and negative matrix results.
- Frozen family: Lightroom and HDRMerge merges, a validation/holdout split, curves,
  masks and SDR rendition captures. Camera Raw's TIFF output carries no SDR
  rendition, so this needs a gain-map export path.
- Opening defaults for unedited PQ, HLG and gain-map sources, and HDR toggling with
  unavailable paired profiles.
- HDR display beyond macOS Develop's Fit view: zoomed views, comparisons, a GPU
  HDR path, Windows Advanced Color, Linux, and highlights beyond the headroom.

## Progress

- [ ] Stage 1: harness, Nikon measurements and codec spike done; fixtures, frozen
  family and display prototype open. The libjxl decision is deferred to #906.
- [x] Stage 2 (#905): HDR settings in the recipe (`model::hdr`), schema 14 and catalog
  version 6 for HDR on, values kept while off without a format change, XMP and
  Lightroom reading and writing, presets, the High Dynamic Range Copy/Sync group,
  and one shared guard refusing HDR on. Profile grouping (52552) and the previous
  reader's profile check are left for stage 3's DCP work.
- [ ] Stage 3: the CPU HDR master (`render_hdr`), HDR profiles rendered and
  importable, the ordinary-curve extension, Exposure, negative Whites, Blacks and the
  limit, measured and validated on the family (above); the SDR rendition everywhere
  else; the release guard lifted with Develop's HDR switch and SDR-rendition status;
  `rawmakase render --hdr`. Open: positive Whites, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows,
  the colour stage, looks, the SDR rendition sliders, 52552 grouping (library only,
  needed when toggling HDR pairs profiles).
- [ ] Stage 6: HDR TIFF export (PQ and HLG 16-bit, linear float; Rec. 2020, Display
  P3, Rec. 709; CICP-tagged ICC; #908), checked against Camera Raw's PQ TIFF through an
  independent decoder; lossless JPEG XL PQ and HLG (and SDR sRGB), checked with
  libjxl's `jxlinfo` and `djxl` and jxl-oxide; gain-map JPEG (ISO 21496-1) checked with
  libultrahdr; JPEG XL gain maps (`jhgm`), the bundle read by libjxl's `jxlinfo`. A
  resized master lost its light above white until #910. Open: lossy JPEG XL waits on
  #906; AVIF and HEIC HDR are not planned for #894.
- [ ] Stage 4: HDR TIFF, PNG, JPEG XL and AVIF files (PQ, HLG or linear in BT.709,
  BT.2020 or P3; identity-curve ICCs; float TIFFs) open as HDR edits
  ([design](hdr-stage4-design.md)): exact light, master identity at their own
  settings, Exposure and geometry. The SDR rendition is the Library's tone map.
  Open: gain-map input, HDR HEIC, other adjustments on HDR files, Transform and
  Upright.
- [ ] Stage 5: macOS HDR display: a float surface through RAWmakase's egui fork
  (`surface_format_selector`, offered upstream), extended sRGB with EDR while an HDR
  photo shows, and the CPU master in Develop's Fit view held to the display's
  headroom, with the Basic panel's note naming it. Checked on a MacBook Pro XDR
  display with a CC0 Z 8 photo. Open: the rest of the stage (above).
